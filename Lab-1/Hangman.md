## ENSE 370 - Software System Design - Laboratory

# Lab 1: Java Refresher
### University of Regina
### Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science - Software Systems Engineering

This laboratory exercise is divided into parts that together introduce students to Java programming, Docker , and GitHub Classroom submission workflow.

-   **Phase 1** serves as a short verification task that ensures students
    can accept a GitHub Classroom assignment, create a simple Java program, and successfully submit it for automated grading.
-   **Phase 2** builds on this foundation and requires students to implement a complete interactive Java application.
  

## Procedure
- Open the GitHub Classroom assignment link on URCourses and accept the assignment.  A private repository will be created automatically for you.
- Clone the repository and use the docker image as a template.
- Complete the two phases

### Phase 1 Hello World
In this task, students are required to write a simple Java program that displays a message on the screen. The goal of this task is to verify that the Java development environment is correctly installed and that students understand the basic structure of a Java program. This task also introduces the GitHub Classroom workflow that will be used for all subsequent labs.

The program must consist of a single Java class containing a `main` method. When the program is executed, it must print the message:

    Hello, ENSE 370!

exactly as shown.
